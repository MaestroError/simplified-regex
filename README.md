- Implement BuilderPattern methods in builderMethodsMixin +
- Add tests for builderMethodsMixin methods +
- source setting feature directly from action methods (`.check(source)`) +
- Implement options and register in OptionsBuilder
- Implement patterns using builderMethodsMixin's methods

#### GPT rewriting tips

- Use short messages (rewrite 10-15 methods per prompt)
- Ask it to write tests and check tests logic manually
- Giving some starting point (even empty methods) or an example (Even the previously generated code) makes it to generate more precise code and keep consistancy
