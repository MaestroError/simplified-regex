#### GPT rewriting tips

- Use short messages (rewrite 10-15 methods per prompt).
- Ask it to write tests and check tests logic manually.
- If it goes wrong way, just stop it and tell the correct one.
- Giving some starting point (even empty methods) or an example (Even the previously generated code) makes it to generate more precise code and keep consistancy.
- Often GPT does everything correct and the process becomes boring at some moment.
